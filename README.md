# Personal-Dictionary-and-Vocab-Evaluator
This is the Final Project Repository for CS 546-A course at Stevens Institute of Technology

A web application for users who want to enhance their vocabulary abilities by constructing their own personal dictionary and self-evaluating using the MCQ exams that are generated.

How to Setup:

Run ```npm install``` to install the required dependencies for our project.
